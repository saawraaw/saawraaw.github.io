I am a postdoctoral researcher at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. My research focuses on developing privacy-preserving frameworks in statistics and machine learning, often leveraging techniques from information theory.

I received my PhD in February 2024 from KTH. During my PhD, I introduced **Pointwise Maximal Leakage** (PML), a novel privacy measure that extends both differential privacy and quantitative information flow. PML is operationally meaningful, robust, and flexible. Currently, my research focuses on applying PML to various problems in statistics and learning.
