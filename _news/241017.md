My very first public appearance! :tada: I was invited to speak at `Digitalize in Stockholm 2024`, one of Sweden's premier tech events which is open to the public. I participated in the panel "To Legislate or Not to Legislate the AI Realm" and shared my thoughts on the newly implemented AI Act and its impacts on reseach, innovation, and soceity.
